  TROUBLESHOOTING
  --------------------------------------------
    Insure that you use / and not the \ character for directories!  The \
    character has special meaning in php.
     
    Open www/header.php and set $Debug_Mode = 3...
    This will produce highly useful output for debugging.
    
    If you have trouble, send a support request (see below) with 
    that debug output pasted at the bottom of your message.

  SUPPORT
  --------------------------------------------

    CRITICAL!!  When submitting a support request, always begin by setting 
                $Debug_Mode = 3; in the www/header.php file and then pasting the
                results in the request.  If you can't get zenTrack to run this
                far, THEN YOU MUST SUBMIT YOUR VERSION INFO for zenTrack, your OS,
                your Browser, and your Server, so that we can re-create the error.

  COMMON ERRORS
  --------------------------------------------

  HEADER.PHP MISSING
    -This is probably a cvs checkout.  Just go to the directory where
     you unzipped zentrack and run setup_from_cvs (.cmd on windows) to
     build directories, permissions, and the header.php file.

  BLANK SCREEN
    - Turn on Debug_Mode = 3 in your www/header.php file.  Error messages are
      supressed unless this is on.
      
    - Check your system/apache/php logs!
    
    - Insure that you have not made a syntax error in the www/header.php file
      (you can try restoring the default)
      
    - If you have upgraded, insure that you copied all of the files correctly.
      If some files are missing, this can cause unpredictable errors.
  
  PAGE COLORS ARE BROKEN AND I CAN'T LOGIN 
    - This is a classic sign of data trouble.  Either your login information
      is not correct in www/header.php or there is no data in your database
      (because you have not correctly run the build/seed files yet).
  
  LOGIN PROBLEMS
    -The Administrator password is Administrator, User password is User, Guest
     password is Guest.

    -Logins are case sensitive
    
    -Check your database and insure there are entries in the ZENTRACK_USERS
     table.  If there is an error running the seed_yourdb.sql file (or you
     forgot to run it) then that would certainly prevent a login.

    -If you use .htaccess authentication or run your server on a windows
     machine with a login account, then ZT may attempt to log you in with
     these account settings.  Find the setting in ZENTRACK_SETTINGS called
     allow_htaccess and insure this is set to 0.

  MUST LOG IN TWICE
    - This is almost guaranteed to be the $rootUrl variable.  You can validate
      this by turning on debugging and then looking for the big red note at
      the bottom of the page next to $HTTP_HOST.  When you get it right, it
      will say (matches rootUrl).
      
  SEARCH DOESN'T WORK
    - Check your settings in the field map.  Users mess this up all the time.
      If some field is set to "No" or some other default value which doesn't
      match any records, there will naturally be no results!
      
    - Try turning on debugging and looking for search_tickets... examine the query...
      try it against your database manually... see if something seems out of place.

  REPORT IMAGE PROBLEMS
    -Broken images
      You must have GD 2.0 and freetype installed
      You can view error messages by right clicking on the broken image, and getting the direct url
      When you browse to this url, you will see the error output (possibly the image binary too)

    -To view debugging output for an image, open www/view_image.php and setting $graph->debug to 1-3.
      You will probably want to use 1 or 2, 3 is mostly for developers
      Note that you have to view the image directly to see this (in the page, it just shows a broken image)

    -Problems viewing png images

    You can manually set the image type to "jpeg" if you have
    trouble with pngs by opening includes/reportConfig.php
    and finding the line called image_type.

  EMAIL GATEWAY PROBLEMS
    -Check includes/logs/egate_log for clues
    
    -Make sure you have the egate user account set up with proper permissions 
       (this account doesn't have to be active)
       
    -Make sure you turn on email_gateway in the configuration panel.

    -Make sure that you have your egate scripts chmod to 755 (executable)

  OTHER DATABASE USERS
    -We can support, upon request, DB2, Sybase, or other
     install scripts, with some assistance from you.
