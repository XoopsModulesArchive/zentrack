    Your login id can only be changed by an administrator.
    
    <p><b><?php echo tr('Change Default Bin'); ?></b> - This option can be used to change the
    bin which is loaded when you log in, and the bin selected by default when
    you create new tickets.
    
    <p><b><?php echo tr('Change Language'); ?></b> - You can change the language displayed
    by the application here.  This only changes your language setting and does
    not affect any other users.
