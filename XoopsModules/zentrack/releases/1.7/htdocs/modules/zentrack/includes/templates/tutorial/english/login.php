<p><b>Getting Login and Password</b></p>

<p>Your Login and Password will be provided by a system administrator.  

<p>In general, your password will be the same as your last name (case sensitive!) 
until your first login.</p>

<p><b>Changing Your Password</b></p>
  
<p>Initially, when you log in, you will probably see the change password screen.
This will allow you to change your password to something you can remember.

<p>You may see some instructions to help you create a valid password. 

<p>This is an optional feature to make it harder for others to guess your password, and
you will not be allowed to enter anything which does not conform to this
requirement (if enabled).

<p><b>If you forget your password</b></p>

If you don't stencil your password on the inside of your eyelids like normal
people, then you may occasionally forget them.  When this happens, simply
contact your administrator who can reset your password for you.
