If you are upgrading from version 2.5.5.2 then please read the following information.

BEFORE DOING ANYTHING MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A FULL DATABASE BACKUP AND A BACKUP OF YOUR EXISTING XOOPS ENVIRONMENT (or at least your existing ZenTrackXoops stuff)

I deleted all files from my existing xoops/modules/zentrack directory before continuing with Step 1, however this is not entirely necessary:

Step 1. Unpack the module files into your xoops/modules directory

Step 2. Login as Administrator and Update the ZenTrackXoops module as you would any other module using the Admin tool
	DO NOT UNINSTALL OTHERWISE YOU WILL LOOSE ALL YOUR DATA

Step 3. Point your browser at http://your.xoops.root/modules/zentrack/upgrade/2_5_5_2-to-2_6_0_4.php and click on Submit

Step 4. I recommend that you restart your web browser before accessing your updated module.


That's it. Good luck...
