**ZentrackXoops** is a XOOPS port of zenTrack, a fully customizable help desk, bug tracking, and project management system. It works as a module of the XOOPS CMS with full access and admin rights managed by XOOPS Groups. Clean, simple interface, fully adaptable administration and nicely integrated to XOOPS
